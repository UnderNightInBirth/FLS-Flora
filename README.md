<br>Under Night In-Birth II **FLS Flora** ("False Flora") is a modpack, for the curious, by the curious.

It's the culmination of the minds behind [the only based and open-oriented UNIB research](https://github.com/Fatih120/undernightinbirth), intended to put together a humble but sweeping modpack so that future visionaries are encouraged to make their own mods for the world of the Hollow Night.

FLS Flora transforms the UNI2 experience with:
- Custom characters, both ported and from-scratch
- A unique look and feel
- Lots of BGMs to tune in to
- An unhealthy amount of seamlessly bringing everything together 
- Network play with users of the same mod
- Working Missions and other customizable goodies
- Characters with their own Arcade Stories
- Potential secrets and bosses to fight
- A wonderful and relaxed support community

Not everything is complete, and many more things are to come as contributors add their edits to the game.

# Installing

To download and try out the mod in its current state, clone the repo or [click here to download the pack](https://github.com/UnderNightInBirth/FLS-Flora/archive/refs/heads/game.zip). Navigate to your game's installation folder and unpack the *contents* of FLS-Flora-game in there (overwrite), so your folder should end up looking a bit like this:

Launch the game and you should be good to go! Just avoid playing online with strangers or those who don't have the pack. __When you want to return to vanilla, clean up the extra folders from the repo and use Steam's "Verify Integrity" feature to get the game back to normal__.

# Contributing

This mod is a joint effort among those who spent the time learning the intricacies of the game engine. If you have ideas, want to learn how to add content, or just have a few small contributions such as palettes, you are free to make a pull request, discussion, or a shout-out within or outside the repo. Certain things might need heavy considerations such as characters that skew the game plenty, but we'll do our best to communicate.
