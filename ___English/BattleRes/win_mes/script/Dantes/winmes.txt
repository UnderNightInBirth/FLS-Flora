WinMesScript


WinMes00:
What can you see in the gutter?!
NOTHING! Nothing at all...!
\e

WinMes01:
Not enough rage or suffering!
I want to hear you to scream until your throat is raw!
\e

WinMes02:
A diamond in the rough!
Impressive! Next time, try to kill me!
\e

WinMes03:
Though you are extinguished,
the flame of your fighting spirit continues to burn.
Hmph. Very well. You can go first.
Your flames appear to lack the strength of mine.
\e

WinMes04:
Laws are drafted to be perfect.
But that does not ensure they will actually work.
For all of time, humans have continued to remain volatile beings.
\e

WinMes05:
Good is common, and evil is rare.
And thus good goes unseen while evil flourishes.
And what a struggle it is to stay good...
\e

WinMes06:
Speed itself is my weapon.
The pace of this era suits me.
\e

WinMes07:
What a strange city. Horrible, yet beautiful...
I do not intend to lose myself in battle, but
I can't think of a better way to keep my night interesting.
\e

WinMes08:
Enemies of human order...
You seek to leave the path set for you.
If you are not my prey, then do as you like.
\e

WinMes09:
Your kind are difficult to incinerate.
That just means I'll have to make my flames even hotter.
\e

WinMes10:
All is well, if you are unharmed.
Let my flames be a guiding light for your way home.
That said...
Please don't let your destiny multiply endlessly.
\e

WinMes11:
What could a man once called a child prodigy
want so badly as to be reborn for it?
Or... could it be, that this city is the answer you sought?
\e

WinMes12:
Your flame burns bright.
\e

WinMes13:
Is the sin ignorance, or is it innocence?
You're a boy on the edge, and your destined love
is far too powerful.
\e

WinMes14:
Waiter! Coffee for her, please!
\e

WinMes15:
Stop with the snow, you'll put out my smoke.
I'll warm you up... No, actually...
There will be no light on your path.
\e

WinMes16:
This noise is awful.
Haydee, could you stop the music?
\e

WinMes17:
So my flames cannot burn your resolve, huh?!
Haha, ahahahahahahahaha!
Now go, and atone for your sins!
Call my name if you have need of me!
\e

WinMes18:
Ahh... What fun!
What happier scene could there be,
than having crushed your plot to attain eternal life?!
Suffer forever, in this eternal instant!
\e

WinMes19:
// So that was a Dead Apostle.
I seem to have come to a world I know nothing of.
I may be a restless man, but this is too much, even for me.
\e

WinMes20:
A conceptual holy scripture against rebirth...
Seven deadly sins, seven weapons, and a single...
Unbelievable.
The church's inquisition of heretics has no limits.
\e

WinMes3WinStreak00:
What are you happy about?! Three wins is just the start!
Faster now, and no stopping!
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
Ten wins! Meaningless! But well done!
With you as my opponent,
collecting wins to the far end of my limits feels possible!
\e
