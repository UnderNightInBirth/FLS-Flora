# FLS Flora Roadmap

There are several changes planned and hoped for, but contributors have other things to do as well. Here are some things that need to be worked on for the guidance of the project:

## Characters

- Colour naming, UI stuff in general
- Fixing invisible sprites in Network and all that other data like subtitles and win quotes
- Bugs regarding stale variables
- Missions underway

### Riesbyfe

- Mostly complete in gameplay, just needs her IWEX done and fixed with other moveset fixes
- Full polish of SFX, visuals, and other visual FX
- Beast Mode needs to be more functional and polished
- Needs new palettes!
- Working on her story mode, fully scripted.

### Ingrid

- Has her specials and supers to be finished and rebalanced
- Voices and SFX
- Hurt anims
- Needs new palettes!

### Hammer

- Sandbox character. Will likely be removed in the future and put in archival as making a whole character from absolute scratch is too much for one person (and low ID values are a commodity)

### Edmond Dantes

- Needs to be UNI-fied to how vanilla characters play as he was from ReallyReal's release. With his permission we still want the pack to play as UNI feels
- Attack vectors need to be fixed along with normalizing hurtbox data and attack data
- SE broken?
- Need to UNI-fy base palette

### Ako

- Work on some attacks some more and balance. IW(EX) broken, needs hurt anims and other stuff
- Need to work on getting her FF to involve Rusian assist
- SE broken?
- Needs new palettes!
- Need to UNI-fy base palette

### FLS Ryu

- Needs a lot of his attacks redesigned as he doesn't work how he is in UNI2 and cannot get in or apply pressure.
- Fix some hurt patterns
- IWEX
- Needs a LOT new palettes!

### Yuuki

- Needs a lot of work.

### Celica

To be implemented once IK finishes basic attacks and movement

### Saki

To be implemented once IK finishes basic attacks and movement

### Spoiler!

For Riesbyfe's story. Base skeleton made, now for the 10 attacks or so and all the code.

### Planned characters

Current modders have too much on their plate.

## EXE Hacking
