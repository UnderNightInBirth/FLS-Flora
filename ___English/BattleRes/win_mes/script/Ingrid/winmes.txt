WinMes00:
The heavens can see through everything,
including all there is to know about you.
No matter how dark the void is, a single glint from the sky
is enough to reveal your undraped methodology.
\e

WinMes01:
Nyohohohoho! An unlucky one you are!
Believe me when I say I'm a bit regretful you had
to encounter a rare bird such as myself.
Aren't you surprised? Isn't it surprising?
\e

WinMes02:
Does it sit well with you to continuously expose your weak spots?
I'm going to poke at them, you know?
*Poke*. *Poke*.
\e

WinMes03:
This was for my job. You have my apologies.
Perhaps once the morning sun shines upon you,
you'll be able to let bygones be.
\e

WinMes04:
That wasn't exciting at all!
I cant believe this is the end of that!
\e

WinMes05:
Oh my, that was too boring!
Now what am I supposed to do?
\e

WinMes06:
I know everything you are going to do, even before you do it.
Knowing that, are you going to try again?
\e

WinMes07:
This was for my job. You have my apologies.
