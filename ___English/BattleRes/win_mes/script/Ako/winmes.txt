WinMes00:
Could this be... a real victory?!
I-If that's so, then the loser pays for shipping!
\e

WinMes01:
I'm leveling up even in this getup!
I bet I'm surprisingly strong for a healer! Aren't I?
\e

WinMes02:
Online marriage, online lovey-doveys...
Isn't that the ideal play style!?
What web page has the strategy guide?
\e

WinMes03:
Well then, Rusian. Let's go home!
\e

WinMes04:
This rod's cuteness...
I've only now begun to understand it!
I need to hurry and save before I forget!
\e

WinMes05:
Life may be a kusoge...
But as long as I'm with Rusian, the two of
us will aim to clear the game with smiles!!
\e

WinMes06:
See, isn't my life always stuck on hard mode?
Isn't this a bug? Should I go contact an admin?
...Huh? There's no such thing?
\e

WinMes07:
Even though I was just a little closer to making the kusoge of life more ideal...
Sigh... These normies will never understand...
\e

WinMes3WinStreak00:
Wow, amazing! Three straight wins!
Is this an EXP grinding spot?!
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
Rusian, did you see that!?
Ten straight wins! Ten straight!
