Riesbyfe is a powerhouse character that has several tools to regain pressure at mid-range.\n
She has a plethora of attacks and options at her disposal, making her well-rounded in combat.\n
\n
\k
\\@MESSAGE@
Gauge your opponent by poking with long-reaching attacks such as standing \@B@, \@2+B@, and \@C@.\n
You can also try for \@236+A@ at a safe range, which could lead to a hard knockdown.\n
\n
Catch standing opponents by surprise with an Increased \@6+B@, which is a low attack.\n
If you need to close the gap, you can try to get close with dashing \@C@ into a safe special.\n
\k"

rie_tactics_pressure_start,"\\@MESSAGE@
Once you've made contact with standing \@B@, you can continue into \@B@>\@C@>\@2B@.\n
If your opponent blocks, use a standing or crouching \@A@ to keep Riesbyfe safe.\n
\n
If your attacks hit, proceed to use \@2+C@>\@214+A@>\@236+A@ to deal more damage.\n
\k"

rie_tactics_mixup_start,"\\@MESSAGE@
Once you get close to your opponent, try to confuse them with a low \@Z6+B@,\n
or \@Z+6C@, \@Z236B@, and \@214C@ as overhead options.\n
\n
As \@214C@ and \@Z236B@ are heavy hits, you should be careful while using them without access to Chain Shift.\n
\n
From an Assault, you can try use jumping \@C@ for a slow but reliable overhead attack.\n
\k"

rie_tactics_invincible_start,"\\@MESSAGE@
When your opponent gets aggressive, try reversing the situation\n
with your invulnerable attacks, \@623+B@ or \@623+C@.\n
\n
If you use Chain Shift to confirm the situation first,\n
you won't miss a chance to deal damage.\n
\k"

rie_tactics_antiair_start,"\\@MESSAGE@
If your opponent attacks from the air, take them down with \@B+C@ or \@4+C@ anti-air attacks.\n
If your \@B+C@ lands a counter hit, you can follow it with \@2+C@.\n
\n
Compared to \@B+C@, \@4+C@ can win out against jump attacks even when performed a bit later.\n
This makes it a useful anti-air choice in the heat of the moment.\n
\k"

rie_tactics_ball_invincible_start,"\\@MESSAGE@
If your opponent is threatening you with their projectiles, a properly-timed \@B+C@\n
will grant you a window of invulnerability to evade such attacks\n
and give an opportunity to strike back.\n
\n
Try to hit the projectile with the Force Function, then attempt to follow-up with a powerful attack.\n
\k"

rie_tactics_aaa,"\\@MESSAGE@
If you're stuck in an unfortunate position in the air, you might be able to evade a grounded opponent.\n
Try using an aerial \@B+C@ to dodge oncoming attacks before landing.\n
\n
While this dodge makes you invulnerable, you're unable to act while in the air,
and are put at risk even after you've just landed.\n
Use your aerial Force Function with caution to make the opponent whiff.\n
