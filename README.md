<br>**FLS Flora** ("False Flora") is a modpack for Under Night In-Birth II. It's a group effort behind the humble [documentation repo](https://github.com/Fatih120/undernightinbirth), adding sweeping changes to the game to show off some cool new characters in a fresh coat of paint - all while showcasing how easy it is for anyone to jump in and start modding UNI2 for themselves.

:warning: This repo is in an [ALPHA STATE](manual/ROADMAP.md). Characters are in varied progress. You can still launch the game and enjoy, even on Network, but not everything is ready!

FLS Flora transforms the UNI2 experience with:
- Custom (in-progress) characters, both ported and from-scratch
- A new look and feel
- Lots of BGMs to tune in to
- Ported Type Lumina stages with nighttime edits
- Network play with users of the same mod
- The most relaxed support community around

## Characters

- Riesbyfe Strindvari
- Ingrid (Capcom)
- Edmond Dantes
- Ako (DFCI)
- FLS Ryu (a.k.a. Evil Ryu)
- [And more to come!](manual/ROADMAP.md)

# Installing

To download and try out the mod in its current state, clone the repo or [click here to download the pack](https://github.com/UnderNightInBirth/FLS-Flora/archive/refs/heads/game.zip). Navigate to your game's installation folder and unpack the *contents* of FLS-Flora-game in there (overwrite), so your folder should end up looking a bit like this:

Launch the game (make sure your game language is in **ENGLISH**) and you should be good to go! Just avoid playing online with strangers or those who don't have the pack. __When you want to return to vanilla, clean up the extra folders from the repo and use Steam's "Verify Integrity" feature to get the game back to normal__.
