<br>Under Night In-Birth II **FLS Flora** ("False Flora") is a modpack, made by a few curious minds.

From those behind [the comfiest UNIB resource out there](https://github.com/Fatih120/undernightinbirth), we've added sweeping changes to give the game a new coat of paint, while encouraging other visionaries to crack things open and make their own mods for the world of the Hollow Night.

:warning: This repo is in an ALPHA STATE. Some functions are release-ready, some things are not. Character progress is here and there depending on who you ask. That said, you can still launch the game and enjoy, even on Network, but there will be bugs and potentially crashes for the WIP characters.

<br>

FLS Flora transforms the UNI2 experience with:
- Custom characters, both ported and from-scratch (Workin' on it!)
- A unique look and feel (Workin' on it!)
- Lots of BGMs to tune in to
- Stages ported from a familiar game and edited to feel "nightly"
- Neat touches and an attempt to make edits seem not-out-of-place
- Network play with users of the same mod
- Working Missions and other customizable goodies (Workin' on it!)
- Characters with their own Arcade Stories (Workin' on it!)
- ~~Potential secrets and bosses to fight~~ (Workin' on it!)
- A wonderful and relaxed support community which consistently predicts the future(?)

Not everything is complete, and many more things are to come as contributors add their edits to the game.

# Installing

To download and try out the mod in its current state, clone the repo or [click here to download the pack](https://github.com/UnderNightInBirth/FLS-Flora/archive/refs/heads/game.zip). Navigate to your game's installation folder and unpack the *contents* of FLS-Flora-game in there (overwrite), so your folder should end up looking a bit like this:

Launch the game and you should be good to go! Just avoid playing online with strangers or those who don't have the pack. __When you want to return to vanilla, clean up the extra folders from the repo and use Steam's "Verify Integrity" feature to get the game back to normal__.

# Contributing

This mod is a joint effort among those who spent the time learning the intricacies of the game engine. If you have ideas, want to learn how to add content, or just have a few small contributions such as palettes, you are free to make a pull request, discussion, or a shout-out within or outside the repo. Certain things might need heavy considerations such as characters that skew the game plenty, but we'll do our best to communicate.
