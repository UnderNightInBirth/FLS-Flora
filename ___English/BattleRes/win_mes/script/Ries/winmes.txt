WinMesScript


WinMes00:
This shield is called Gamaliel, the True Apocrypha.
It is the embodiment of order and justice, and rhythmically repels all impurity.
Even with an entire lifetime, your could never best it.
\e

WinMes01:
You mocked my slim figure. I'll have you know that these fists can generate around five tons...
Ah, that's overdoing it... Um, TWO tons of force.
...Don't underestimate the strength of a musician.
\e

WinMes02:
This isn't storytelling at all... Mindless violence is no more than noise.
I may not be one to talk, but you lack in romance.
\e

WinMes03:
Defeating them is one thing, but being unable to care for my body?
No camp sites, no aid workers, no chiropractors...
No one ever told me that my solitary duty would be so severe...
\e

WinMes04:
...Really now, you guys just keep on coming...
You don't even know the proper manners for dueling.
If all you do is fight, you're no better than a parrot.
\e

WinMes05:
My mission shall not fail.
Carrying the two scattered gospels, I will make known the will of my Lord.
Hmm... Is this what victory lines are supposed to sound like?
\e

WinMes06:
How strong...
There was no way I should have won, especially with a spine far sturdier than mine and superior magical power.
But as a pile bunker wielder, it appears that Gamaliel's abilities barely won out.
\e

WinMes07:
It looks like I won this time, Sion.
...By the way, I was wondering if you could teach me Japanese when you have the time.
...Um, I just can't get the hang of reading and writing kanji...
\e

WinMes08:
...Sleep, Sion. There is no value in a life devoid of sunlight.
\e

WinMes09:
You've fallen to the ranks of a C-list actor, like a stagehand being given a role.
\e

WinMes10:
What's... your name? ...I see.
I'm a knight of the church, but we're not strict about everything.
...Um. If you'd like, how about we get some tea after this?
\e

WinMes11:
I don't really have a true grudge against you, but...
...Maybe I should beat him up a little bit more...
\e

WinMes12:
Creepy... cute... creepy... cute...
...creepy-cute......... ...huh?!
I think I just saw a really happy creature... I-It was just a dream...
...That paradise had to be a dream.
\e

WinMes13:
Haa... This constant string of men is depressing...
\e

WinMes14:
I've finished treating your wounds.
...Don't look so upset; I was careful.
What kind of knight would I be if I injured such a pretty face?
\e

WinMes15:
There's no need to repent. Just return to ash, vampire.
The melody of purgatory's anguish suits your kind.
\e

WinMes16:
...She ran away so quickly. I'm glad her wounds were light, but...
Calling me ""Mister"" was pretty rude.
\e

WinMes17:
...Silence is not a sound.
If it were, it would be nothing but the sound of death...
Perhaps you were the embodiment of that concept.
\e

WinMes18:
...It's broken... Oh, but what... ...what artistic molding it has.
...I wonder if I could fix it... It sure would be great to have one...
\e

WinMes19:
This again... What's wrong with this town? ...No, that's not it.
Is it my own body that has something wrong with it?....
\e

WinMes20:
Even with these deep wounds, I don't feel a single bit of pain.
No matter how I feel about it, it doesn't change who I am.
\e

WinMes21:
I've made you suffer alone for all this time.
Sleep well, Sion... I'll be joining you soon.
Yes... As soon as the dawn breaks.
\e

WinMes22:
...I won...?
I thought you had it in you, but you have no hope
of even matching Osiris if you can't beat me.
...No, I'm sure you'll be happier disappearing without meeting that thing.
\e

WinMes23:
Eh? You know of a Dead Apostle who came in by plane?
You're kidding! You won't fool me that easily.
Now show me around this new millennium like you promised.
\e

WinMes24:
Allow me to correct you. I am no well-bred lady.
I myself don't even know how I lived in the days before the Cardinal took me in.
\e

WinMes25:
Alright... I've finally obtained the Japanese art...
This molding, this appearance...
If this is a dream, don't wake me up...
Yeah... I'll have to buy a dedicated display case for it when I get back.
\e

WinMes26:
I beat them... a part of this planet, with my own hands...
...Haha, how ridiculous...
Why couldn't I pull off this kind of miracle back then...?!.
\e

WinMes27:
She was clearly dodgy. Was she one of the poachers?
\e

WinMes28:
How did it come to this......? Ohh, now I really am a thief!
What am I going to tell Sion...
\e

WinMes29:
Whew, that sure was exhausting. But it's all worth it if you guys can be safe.
\e

WinMes30:
Damn it...... I'm feeling so strange.
I accidentally put my full strength into that...
...She flew off into the sky and isn't coming down, but she's probably fine...
She's fine... right?
\e
